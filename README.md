DeepMed Intelligent Consultation System
(Built using the QWEN large language model and a local knowledge base with RAG technology)

Developed with LangChain4j, the system constructs an intelligent medical consultation agent integrated with OpenAI's large language model, supporting backend tool calls such as appointment booking and modification.

Utilizes Redis vector database and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, document-based medical Q&A responses.

Implements a custom ChatMemoryStore interface to support multi-turn conversation memory and recovery using MongoDB.
